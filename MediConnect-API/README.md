## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (local or cloud, e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Accounts and API keys for:
  - [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) (for image uploads)
  - [Razorpay](https://razorpay.com/) and [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) (for payments)

## Installation

To set up MediConnect-API locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lord-Vesta/MediConnect-API.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd MediConnect-API
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following configuration:
   ```plaintext
   PORT=5000
   CLOUDINARY_NAME=your_cloudinary_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_SECRET_KEY=your_cloudinary_secret_key
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   ADMIN_EMAIL=your_admin_email
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
   RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id
   RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_secret_key
   CURRENCY=USD
   ```

   Replace placeholders (e.g., `your_cloudinary_name`) with actual values from your Cloudinary, MongoDB, Razorpay, and Stripe accounts.

5. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Test the API**:
   The server will run on `http://localhost:5000` (or your specified port). Use tools like Postman or Insomnia to test endpoints.
